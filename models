# if the models for your application live in the module myapp.models 
# (the package structure that is created for an application by the manage.py startapp script), 
# INSTALLED_APPS should read, in part:

# INSTALLED_APPS = [
#     #...
#     'myapp',
#     #...
# ]
# When you add new apps to INSTALLED_APPS, be sure to run manage.py migrate,
#  optionally making migrations for them first with manage.py makemigrations.
